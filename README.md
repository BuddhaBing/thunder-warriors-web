* Towers cost gold to buy.
* Each enemy killed gives the player additional gold.
* Some towers can be upgraded (this also costs gold).
* Towers can be sold in return for gold.
* If an enemy makes it to the end of the route, the player loses a life.
* If the player loses all their lives, the game is over.
* If the player endures all of the enemy waves without losing all their lives, the level is complete.
